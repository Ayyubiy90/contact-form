## My Process üõ†Ô∏è

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript for form validation and interactivity

### What I Learned

This project provided valuable experience in creating accessible and responsive forms. Key learnings include:

- Implementing real-time form validation using JavaScript
- Creating a mobile-first, responsive design with CSS Flexbox
- Enhancing accessibility with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- Managing form states (error, success) effectively

Code snippets I'm proud of:

```html
<div class="form-group">
    <label for="email">Email Address <span aria-label="required">*</span></label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required aria-required="true">
    <div class="error-message" id="email-error"></div>
</div>
```

```css
button:hover, button:focus {
    background-color: hsl(169, 82%, 22%);
}
```

```js
function isValidEmail(email) {
    const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    return emailRegex.test(email);
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

- Exploring more advanced JavaScript form validation techniques
- Implementing custom form controls with enhanced accessibility
- Integrating with backend APIs for real form submissions

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Comprehensive web development documentation.
- [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) - Excellent resource for accessibility best practices.
